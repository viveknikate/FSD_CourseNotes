     Section 2: Introduction to HTML
          HTML:
               Hyper Text Markup Language
          
          -Heading:
               h1 to h6
               <h1>Hello world..!</h1>
               here,
                    Anything inside the Angular bracket are tags, <h1> is a Opening tag.
                    </h1> is a Closing tag.
               
               Element:-
                    Content & tag Combinedly called element, 
                         <h1>Hello world..!</h1>
          
          -There's a couple of things to note in terms of do's and don'ts when it comes to heading elements that
               I want to talk to you about.
               One important rule is notice how in our exercise there was only one H1.
               It's not good practice to have more than one H1 because the H1 is the very top level heading.
               Imagine the H1 as the book title and the table of contents as including the other parts
               So maybe the H2 would be the first chapter.
               Don't have more than one H1.
               Instead, if you need another subtitle or another level of heading, then go to the H2 or H3 or all
               of the other ones up until H6.
               Now the other thing to watch out for is don't skip a level.
               When you're creating heading elements, don't go straight from H1 to H3.
               If you have an H3, there should also be an H2 somewhere on that web page.
               Instead, I recommend to just go in order when you have an H1 that you've created and then you realize
               you need another heading, then go to an H2.
               And then if you need another level of heading that's even lower in priority, go to an H3.
               Don't jump between the different level headings.

          -Paragraph <p> :
               <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
               -paragraph used to organize content properly, to tell
                that where statement ends & where new one starts.
          
          -Self Closing tags:-     
               void element
               eg.
                    <hr />    Horizontal Rule
                    <br />    break

     Section 5: Introduction to CSS
          -CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
          -Adding CSS into HTML
               -There are 3 ways to do it.
                    1] Inline           <tag style="" />                        - Least recommended (use to target only particular/ one element)
                    2] Internal         <style> CSS </style>
                    3] External         <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />               - Most recommended

                                   //styles
                                   color:red;
                              }
                         </style>

                         or
                         [attribute="value"]{
                              //styles

               •Margin:
                    -distance between border & other content's on page.
                    
                    Margin - Individual Sides
                    CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:
                         margin-top
                         margin-right
                         margin-bottom
                         margin-left

                    All the margin properties can have the following values:
                         auto - the browser calculates the margin
                         length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
                         % - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
                         inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element

                    Tip: Negative values are allowed.

                    Example
                         Set different margins for all four sides of a <p> element:
                         p {
                         margin-top: 100px;
                         margin-bottom: 100px;
                         margin-right: 150px;
                         margin-left: 80px;
                         }
                    
                    
                    -If the margin property has four values:
                         margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
                              top margin is 25px
                              right margin is 50px
                              bottom margin is 75px
                              left margin is 100px

                    -If the margin property has three values:
                         margin: 25px 50px 75px;
                              top margin is 25px
                              right and left margins are 50px
                              bottom margin is 75px

                    -If the margin property has two values:
                         margin: 25px 50px;
                              top and bottom margins are 25px
                              right and left margins are 50px

                    -If the margin property has one value:
                              margin: 25px;
                                   all four margins are 25px

                    -The auto Value
                         You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.
                           margin: auto;
                    
                    -div element:
                         division element to make separate section on page.
               
     Section 7: Intermediate CSS
          -Spcificity & Inheritance
               1) Position-
                    li{
                         color:green;
                         color:red;
                    }
                    li{
                         color:black;
                    }
                    -here black color will gets applied to the li item.
                    -its completely at the end.

               2) Spcificity-
                    -element
                    -class selector          
                    -attribute selector
                    -id selector

                    (element selector) < (class selector) < (attribute selector) < (id selector) < (inline styling)

                    -at the end if inline styling is present then it'll get applied else, styles which are
                     defined in ID will gets applied.

               3) Type-
                    -External
                    -Internal
                    -Inline
                    (Inline) > (Internal) > (External)
                    
                    -at the end the styles if mentioned inline it'll get applied
                         else it'll check for Internal styles <style> </style> within styles tag
                         or else it'll go for external styles.
                    eg.
                         -if the case is like this.
                          styles mentioned internally also & added the external file after internal styling
                          then it will override all your internal styling
                          
                         <style>
                              h1{
                                   color:red !important; 
                              }
                         </style>
                         <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">

                         -here in above case h1 color will get changed according to the color mentioned inside style.css file
                          coz it is added after internal styling so it will override all internal styles.

               4) Importance-
                    eg.
                         color: red;
                         color: yellow !important;
                              -this style will override all your other styles
                              -even inline style & Position does not matter
                              -if you add at the top later words changed to bottom
                              -still the important one style gets applied.
                              -color will  be yellow only
                         
                         h1{
                              color:rgb(255, 255, 255) !important; 
                              color:red; 
                              color:rgb(71, 42, 42) ; 
                              color:blue;
                         }
                              -here according to Position the blue is at the last so
                               the blue color should be get applied but here white will be applied coz its important.

          -Combining CSS selector
               1) Group Selector:
                    - it will apply to all selector mentioned.
                    - comma(,) between the selectors.
                     Syntax:
                         selector1, selector2,..., selector N{
                              //styles
                         }
                     eg.
                         h1, h2, h3, div, p{
                              border: 4px solid pink;
                              border-radius: 2px;
                              color: blue;
                         }

               2) Child Selector:
                    -apply to the direct child of left side.
                    -greater than (>) symbol between selectors.
                    -one level down only
                    -only children no childrens of children.
                    -only child.
                    Syntax:
                         selector1 >  selector2 {
                              //styles
                         }
                    eg.
                         div > p {
                              color: firebrick;
                         }

                         .box > h1{                              //class name box having child all child h1 has bg color is yellow
                              background-color: yellow;
                         }

               3) Descendant Selector:
                    -Apply to all Descendant of left side
                    -space between the selectors
                     Syntax:
                         selector1 selector2{
                              //styles
                         }
                    eg.
                         div li{
                              color: blue;
                         }
               
               4) Chaining selectors:
                    -Chaining is used to be very specific element to style.
                    -super specific selector.
                    -no spaces between selector.
                    -start with html element only.
                    -if start class name or id name then all will
                    -consider as id/ class name.

          -CSS Positioning
               1) Static:
                    -This is default positioning  

               2) Relative:
                    -It will Positioned relatively by the current/ original position of that element/object

               3) Absolute:
                    -Absolute positioned element is get out of the flow of html document.
                    -elements which are below this element will takes it's place
                    -Absolute will An element with position: absolute; 
                     is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport)
                    -if ancestor has that position: relative style is mentioned.

               4) Fixed:

                     still it is there on same location of page.

                    -higher the value will display the element/ content on top  of other;
                    
                     Syntax:
                         z-index: <number>;
                         eg.
                          z-index: -1;
                          z-index: 1;
