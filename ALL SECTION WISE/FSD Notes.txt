     Section 2: Introduction to HTML
          HTML:
               Hyper Text Markup Language
          
          -Heading:
               h1 to h6
               <h1>Hello world..!</h1>
               here,
                    Anything inside the Angular bracket are tags, <h1> is a Opening tag.
                    </h1> is a Closing tag.
               
               Element:-
                    Content & tag Combinedly called element, 
                         <h1>Hello world..!</h1>
          
          -There's a couple of things to note in terms of do's and don'ts when it comes to heading elements that
               I want to talk to you about.
               One important rule is notice how in our exercise there was only one H1.
               It's not good practice to have more than one H1 because the H1 is the very top level heading.
               Imagine the H1 as the book title and the table of contents as including the other parts
               So maybe the H2 would be the first chapter.
               Don't have more than one H1.
               Instead, if you need another subtitle or another level of heading, then go to the H2 or H3 or all
               of the other ones up until H6.
               Now the other thing to watch out for is don't skip a level.
               When you're creating heading elements, don't go straight from H1 to H3.
               If you have an H3, there should also be an H2 somewhere on that web page.
               Instead, I recommend to just go in order when you have an H1 that you've created and then you realize
               you need another heading, then go to an H2.
               And then if you need another level of heading that's even lower in priority, go to an H3.
               Don't jump between the different level headings.

          -Paragraph <p> :
               <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
               -paragraph used to organize content properly, to tell
                that where statement ends & where new one starts.
          
          -Self Closing tags:-     
               void element
               eg.
                    <hr />    Horizontal Rule
                    <br />    break
