HTML Boilerplate:   Simply the structure of writing HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>     - says reading document of HTML5 version
<html lang="en">    
    <head> contain info of website
    <meta> info of website
    <title> name displayed over tab bar

    <body> content of site goes in body
==================================================
<em> or <i> tag for italics always prefer to use <em> tag cause it conveys the meaning
<b> or <strong> for boldness of text always use strong.

semantic in HTML:A semantic element/tag clearly describes its meaning 
                 to both the browser and the developer
                 eg. <form> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

non-semantic tag:   <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content

-to center element use <center> tag or
    text-align:center;  or
    display: flex; then justify-content:center;
